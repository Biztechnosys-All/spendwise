                                <p>Many non-UK residents choose to open a bank account in their own country as opposed to in the UK; however, a bank in another country will normally require you to legalise or ‘apostille’ your UK company documents.</p>
                                <p>Our <a href="/apostilled-documents/">Apostilled Documents Service</a> can be added to any of our company formation packages on our Checkout page.</p>

                                <p>† All registered office and service address mail (official government mail) will be scanned and emailed to you free of charge.

                    <ul>
                        <li>18.1 The price of any Services that you may purchase from us is set out under the relevant service option you select on our Website. Where you place an order by phone or email, we will confirm with price with you before an order is made.  Unless otherwise stated, all prices exclude VAT, which will be payable by you at the prevailing rate on the date of purchase of the Services.</li>
                        <li>18.2 We generally charge you when you place your order. However, for some products we take payment at regular intervals, as explained below under “continuous payment authorisation”.</li>
                        <li>18.3 Subject to any additional charges or variations in price in accordance with these Terms, the total purchase price, including VAT (if any), will be displayed in your shopping cart prior to you confirming the order. The total purchase price will not include the applicable Companies House fee which must be paid by you in addition to the price of the Services unless expressly stated.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>18.4 Price variation in relation to Companies House fees</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>18.4.1 If you have purchased a renewable service, and Companies House fees increase on or before the date that your application/filing is submitted, we will be entitled to recover the increase in fee from you by charging the card we have on record. We will charge you for this amount before the date of the relevant filing/application. The increase in fee will also apply to all subsequent renewals of the service and will be added to the price of your subscription upon your next renewal.</li>
                                <li>18.4.2 If you have purchased a one-off service and Companies House fees increase, we will be entitled to pass on this increase to you and will charge you the difference in Companies House fee between the date you purchased the service and the date your application/filing is made. We will do this by charging the card we have on file.</li>
                                <li>18.4.3 For the avoidance of doubt, these clauses apply to all Services regardless of whether they are expressed to include the Companies House fee. Where Services are expressed to include this fee, all references are to the Companies House fee at the date of your purchase, and we shall be entitled to charge any increase in fee in accordance with the above terms.</li>
                                <li>18.4.4 In the event that we do not receive payment of the increase in fee from you, we shall be under no obligation to provide the remainder of any Service and shall have no liability of whatever nature.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>18.5 If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the Services, we adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</li>
                        <li>18.6 If we are unable to collect any payment you owe us, we may charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% a year above the Bank of England base rate at the time interest is charged, but at 4% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%. This interest accrues on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You pay us the interest together with any overdue amount.</li>
                        <li>18.7 We reserve the right to update the prices of any Services without prior notice or explanation. Every effort is made to ensure that all prices displayed on the Website are correct; however, in the event of serious error, any transaction shall be voided by us, entitling you to a full refund.</li>
                        <li>18.8 You must pay all amounts due to us in connection with the Services in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).</li>

                            <strong>18.9 Continuous payment authorisation</strong>
                            <p>18.9.1 Your acceptance of these Terms means you are granting us continuous payment authority of the card used to purchase the original Service (or an alternative one, if supplied), for the following:</p>
                            <ul class="disc">
                                <li>Renewable services - fees due will be processed on the card originally used to purchase the service (or an alternative, if supplied) on the date of expiry of the service period. Should you wish to cancel the service you must send notice to info@1stformations.co.uk and we must receive this notice prior to the Renewal Date.</li>
                                <li>Mail forwarding services - the cost of postage and handling fees will be taken on the card used to purchase the service (or an alternative if supplied), but will be processed automatically on a monthly basis.</li>
                                <li>To recover any increase in Companies House fees as described in clause 18.4.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>18.9.2 You must have an active card with adequate funds attached to your account at the time of payment collection. If you fail to meet this requirement, interest will be applied as outlined in these Terms, and the corresponding Services will be terminated immediately.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>19.	Refunds: General</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>19.1 The following clauses will apply in addition to any express right to a refund as stated in these Terms, but will be subject to any exclusions contained within these Terms.</li>
                        <li>19.2 In the event you make a purchase of an Additional Service but change your mind, provided we have not already started working on providing the Additional Service and notice to cancel is given within 14 calendar days of the purchase date, you will be entitled to a refund of all fees paid to us. A refund will not be given for cancellation requests made after 14 calendar days from the date of purchase or where we have started working on providing the Additional Service you wish to cancel.</li>
                        <li>19.3 You will not be entitled to a refund where we cancel any Service due to your failure to supply proof of ID and proof of address as required by these Terms and as necessary to ensure we fulfil our obligations regarding the current Anti-Money Laundering regulations and KYC requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

As part of this review, you will be required to provide all necessary documentation we decide necessary to enable us to identify the ownership structure of the overseas corporate entity and to satisfy ourselves of any individual(s) that require an identity verification check as required under the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019. Any ultimate beneficial owners that are identified as part of the Overseas Compliance Review will be required to undergo identity verification in accordance with these Terms. The Overseas Compliance Review shall incur an additional fee for the time spent charged at an hourly rate of
                            £110 plus VAT and billed in increments of 15 minutes with a minimum charge of £27.50 plus VAT per incorporation (the “Overseas Compliance Review Fee”).

In instances where we cannot accurately estimate the value of the contents of the parcel, we will contact you requesting the value of the contents and will only forward the parcel upon receiving a response from you. You warrant and represent to us that all responses you give in relation to the contents of the parcel will be true, accurate and not misleading and that the contents shall not be illegal or unethical in either the UK or the country in which the forwarding address is situated. Should we receive no contact from you within 30 calendar days regarding the value of the contents, the parcel will be returned to sender.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>24.4.1 When you purchase a Registered Office Service and/or Service Address Service from us, you are agreeing to use our Digital Mailroom Service, whereby all UK government mail, as well as Court documents, will be received at our address, securely opened and scanned by our automated mail handling equipment and sent to you by email (with the exception of cheques from official government bodies, which will be sent to your forwarding address by post). A further electronic copy of your government mail will be available for you to view, download or print, in your Spendwise’ online customer account area.

                                <li>24.4.3 If you purchase a Registered Office Service and/or Service Address Service and we are not provided with your Corporate Entity’s authentication code, we will not be able to update Companies House with the details of this purchase.</li>
                                <li>24.4.4 When you purchase a company address service from us, you are authorising us to receive, sort and forward mail on your behalf. Our sorting process will involve the opening of any mail delivered to us to enable us to categorise it appropriately.</li>

                                <li>24.4.6 We reserve the right to cancel any and all company address services with immediate effect, should we believe you have caused or are likely to have an adverse effect our reputation and/or business. If we exercise this right, you shall not be entitled to a refund and we shall have no liability. Our address will be removed from Companies House records, and it will be changed to your residential address or any other address you have previously provided us for this purpose. If you are a non-UK resident and do not have a UK address to use for this purpose, we will apply to Companies House to have our address removed by form RP07. This new address information will be registered with Companies House and displayed on public record.</li>
                                <li>24.4.7 Multiple Corporate Entities cannot use a single address service. If you require an address service for multiple Corporate Entities, you must purchase a separate address service for each Corporate Entity.</li>

This limit is imposed because we are a mail forwarding service and do not have the storage facilities to store large parcels.</li>
                                <li>24.4.9 Should we receive mail returned to us which we have previously forwarded to the forwarding address we have on file for you, we will contact you to clarify the forwarding address we have on file. Any returned mail which is subsequently re-sent by post to you will be charged at Royal Mail postal rates + 15%, unless we are satisfied an error has been made by us. Where you do not respond within 14 calendar days, unclaimed mail will be securely destroyed.</li>
                                <li>24.4.10	With regards our Digital Business Address Service, any mail containing a cheque, bank card or other item deemed to be of value, as well as any item of mail larger than A4 size, will be forwarded to you by post.

                                <li>24.4.11	Regarding our Digital Business Address Service, all original copies of your mail will be securely stored for a period of 7 calendar days, during which time you will be able to request they are forwarded to you by Royal Mail post, at a charge of Royal Mail postal rates plus 15%. After the expiry of 7 calendar days, unclaimed mail will be securely destroyed.</li>
                                <li>24.4.12	If we forward mail to you by courier, we will require payment in advance from you. A receipted invoice will be raised and forwarded to you immediately after payment is taken. The acceptance of these Terms means you are granting us authority to take payment using your payment card details stored on our system. In the event the cost to forward an item by courier is substantial, we may contact you to seek your approval before processing the item. Please note our 15% handling fee also applies to courier deliveries.</li>
                                <li>24.4.13	If we forward parcels, packets and/or letters by Royal Mail Special Delivery, International Signed For, International Tracked, and International Tracked &amp; Signed, we may require payment in advance. A receipted invoice will be raised and forwarded to you immediately after payment is taken. The acceptance of these Terms means you are granting us authority to take payment using your payment card details stored on our system.</li>
                                <li>24.4.14	In the event we are unable to deliver an item of mail or where advance payment is required and we are unable to take advance payment, we will contact you by email, telephone or post and request your assistance. If we do not receive a response within 30 calendar days we reserve the right to return the item to sender or dispose of it, as appropriate.</li>
                                <li>24.4.15	Where you possess a negative account balance, we reserve the right to hold mail for any of our address services from being sent to you, until such time as the amount of the account balance owed, including any applicable interest is paid in full. You will be notified by email if an item of mail is held because you possess a negative account balance. Mail held for this reason will be held for 30 calendar days. If you have not paid the negative account balance within 30 calendar days, the item of mail will either be returned to sender, or it will be destroyed if we would incur a charge to return the item of mail to the sender. In the event that this happens you will still remain liable for all outstanding payments.</li>
                                <li>24.4.16	If you purchase a Registered Office Address Service or Service Address Service from us, it is your responsibility to ensure the correct address for the Corporate Entity is showing on Companies House for its registered office or service address. When an address service is not purchased as part of an incorporation package, we are not responsible for and accept no liability in relation to updating your Corporate Entity's addresses at Companies House.</li>
                                <li>24.4.17	Where you have purchased any of our company address services (Registered Office Address Service, Service Address Service or Business Address Service) and continue to use our address for more than 14 calendar days after the date on which the relevant service is terminated, this address service will be deemed to have been renewed, and you will be liable for payment in full for the service.</li>
                                <li>24.4.18	To ensure Corporate Entities using our address services comply with the London Local Authorities Act 2007, you must ensure that you do not provide our registered office address for business purposes to third parties if you do not have an active Business Address Service with us. Any general business mail received for Corporate Entities that do not have an active business address service will be held for a maximum of 30 calendar days or until a Business Address Service is purchased, whichever is earlier. After 30 calendar days, the mail will be returned to the sender if a Business Address Service is not purchased.</li>
                                <li>24.4.19 Where you choose mail forwarding by post in relation to any of our address services, you accept that we may put any director of your Corporate Entity's full name on the address label, together with a contact number that we have on record as associated with your account. This is to assist in ensuring that delivery is successful and should the delivery service call you in relation to delivery, you must co-operate with them.</li>

                        <li>27.9 We will send any transactional documents that we produce at your request (for example, in accordance with clause 27.1.3 of these Terms) to the relevant person(s) electronically via DocuSign for execution.

                                <li>our role in the provision of these services will be limited to that of the referrer; and</li>
                                <li>Bizik's terms and conditions will apply to such services.</li>

                    <h3>29.	Termination</h3>

                        <li>29.1 The Customer may terminate any of the Services which are sold on an annual basis by giving us 30 calendar days’ written notice. Where the Customer does so, the Customer shall not be entitled to any refund.</li>
                        <li>
                            29.2 We may terminate the provision of any of the Services without liability to the Customer immediately on giving notice to the Customer if:
                            <ul class="disc">

                                <li>the Customer does not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information, cooperation, or access that we need to provide the Services or any part of them; or</li>
                                <li>the Customer commits a breach of any of these Terms and (if such a breach is remediable) the Customer fails to remedy that breach within 14 calendar days of being notified of the breach; or</li>
                                <li>the Customer suspends, or threatens to suspend, payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or</li>
                                <li>the Customer fails to comply with any laws applicable to it; or </li>
                                <li>the Customer suspends, or threatens to suspend, or ceases or threatens to cease to carry on all or a substantial part of its business; or</li>
                                <li>you or the Customer fails to comply with our KYC and Anti-Money Laundering procedures and policies. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any breach of clause 22.8 in relation to the provision of any requested materials; or</li>
                                <li>in our sole discretion, we deem that any association with the Customer or any connected director, shareholder or representative presents a reputational risk to us; or </li>
                                <li>we are required to terminate the provision of Services in accordance with the law.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>29.3 In addition to the above, we may terminate the Services without liability at any time and in our absolute discretion unless explicitly stated otherwise within these Terms.</li>
                        <li>29.4 Our packages contain a variety of different Services. We may immediately terminate or cancel the provision of any such Services, or part of them, where providing or continuing to provide them would pose the risk that we are acting unlawfully, or put us in breach of our compliance policies. If this happens, you may be entitled to a reasonably proportionate refund (as determined at our sole discretion) of fees paid for the Services which you have not received. This does not limit our termination rights as set out in the above clauses.</li>

                    <h3>35. Additional terms applicable to accountants and other intermediaries</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>35.1 These additional terms shall apply to you if you are purchasing any of our services for the benefit of someone else (“end client") as an intermediary (e.g. an accountant purchasing the Services from us as principal, but for the benefit of its own client) (an "<strong>Intermediary</strong>").</li>
                        <li>35.2 We (in our absolute discretion) shall determine whether you are an Intermediary for the purposes of this clause 35.</li>
                        <li>
                            35.3 For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise agreed in writing by us:
                            <ul>
                                <li>35.3.1 no natural person shall be an Intermediary; and</li>
                                <li>35.3.2 in circumstances, where a natural person makes an order on behalf of an Intermediary, that natural person shall be deemed to be the lead contact for the Intermediary, but not the Intermediary itself.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>35.4 For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge and accept that the terms contained in this clause shall apply to you in addition to all other general and service specific terms.</li>
                        <li>35.5 We will only accept orders for Services from accountants and intermediaries if they are registered for Anti-Money Laundering Supervision. We will request, and you must provide, evidence of such registration. This may include, for example, a registration number, or a certificate of supervision. We are entitled to request further information at our sole discretion should we deem this necessary in order to verify your supervision status.</li>
                        <li>35.6 If we are unable to verify your supervision status, or you do not comply with our requests for evidence and/or further information, we shall be entitled to reject or cancel your order immediately without notice. We shall have no liability in respect of any such rejection or cancellation save where you have pre-paid for Services, in which case your sole remedy will be entitlement to a refund of any funds paid to us in connection with the rejected or cancelled order.</li>
                        <li>35.7 You must ensure that at all times throughout the duration of the provision of any Services, you maintain an active payment card on file. Where your card is due to expire, you must provide updated payment details to us prior to the expiry date.</li>
                        <li>35.8 You must ensure that at the time of payment collection, there is an active card on your file which has sufficient available funds to satisfy the upcoming payment. Failure to do so will result in interest being charged in accordance with these Terms and the immediate termination of the relevant Services.</li>
                        <li>35.9 Where any company address service is cancelled or terminated for any reason, we shall be entitled to use the address we have on file for you to replace our own. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of such address as the Corporate Entity’s registered office at Companies House.</li>
                        <li>35.10 Where you have purchased any of our company address services (Registered Office Service, Service Address Service or Business Address Service) and the Corporate Entity continues to use our address for more than 14 calendar days after the date on which the relevant service is terminated or cancelled, this address service will be deemed to have been renewed/used, and you will be liable for payment in full for the service. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you or your end client changes the Corporate Entity address to avoid liability for payment.</li>
                        <li>35.11 Unless otherwise agreed with you in writing, you acknowledge and accept that we shall have no contact with or liability (of whatever nature and howsoever arising) to your end client. Where you purchase any Services, the contract for those Services is between you and us, for which you shall be personally liable. Therefore, no action or inaction on the part of your end client will affect the operation of these Terms.</li>
                        <li>35.12 You acknowledge and accept that you shall have no extra rights of termination which are not set out within these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, you shall not be entitled to terminate, nor receive a refund in relation to the provision of any Services where the reason for such termination is that you are no longer working with, or do not have contact with, your end client.</li>
                        <li>35.13 You are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness and timing of all information to be provided to us in connection with the provision of the Services. This includes but is not limited to the filling out of all application forms and questionnaires. We shall provide reasonable support should you need assistance with this; however, under no circumstances shall we be responsible for filling out any applications on your behalf.</li>
                        <li>35.14 We do not currently offer white labelling of our Services, or any documentation in respect of the Services.</li>
                        <li>35.15 You acknowledge and accept that we shall only discuss your account with the named account holder. If you wish to authorise another person to speak with us on your behalf, you must confirm to us the name of the person that you are authorising beforehand. We will not discuss your account with any person who has not been previously authorised by you.</li>
                        <li>35.16 If you wish to transfer your account to your end client, you must contact us to make a transfer request and provide evidence that your end client wishes to take over the account. We will be unable to transfer the account unless this has been done. Any transfer of the account may be subject to additional AML/ID checks at our discretion.</li>
                        <li>35.17 You shall not, and shall procure that any end client shall not, open a new account with us in order to bypass the transfer process described at clause 35.16 above.</li>

                    <h3>36. Cashback</h3>

                        <li>36.1 We may (but are not obliged) to offer a cashback incentive scheme to Customers who have opened a Revolut business bank account using a referral link provided by us.</li>
